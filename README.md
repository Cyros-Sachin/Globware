2️⃣ Install Dependencies
sh

3️⃣ Run the Project
sh

npm start
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000/.

🛠 Assumptions & Considerations
The project fetches users from https://reqres.in/api/users.

User edits and deletions are stored locally using localStorage.

Editing a user updates localStorage, so changes persist.

If users disappear, clear localStorage and refresh the page.

Prev/Next buttons handle pagination, fetching users dynamically.

❓ Troubleshooting
Problem: Users disappear after refreshing
Solution: Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Local Storage → Clear it and refresh.

Problem: Styling issues
Solution: Ensure styles.css is properly linked in components.

💡 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add backend support to persist user edits/deletes.
🔹 Improve UI with animations & better responsiveness.
🔹 Implement authentication for user management.
